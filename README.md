# Manual Zephyr FUSB302B USB-C Trigger App

This is a zephyr application which talks to a FUSB302B chip as explained in this excellent
[series on USB-C by Arya Voronova on hackaday](https://hackaday.com/series_of_posts/all-about-usb-c/).
The goal is to absorb the functionality in a working [TCPC driver for the FUSB302B](https://github.com/ottojo/zephyr_fusb302b).
